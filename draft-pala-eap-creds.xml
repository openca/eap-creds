  <abstract>
    <t>
        With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that rely on strong credentials
        (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network access, the need for a standard
        credentials provisioning layer is paramount. In particular, since EAP is deployed for
        authentication needs, the authors extend this use-case by including support for provisioning and
        management of credentials.
    
        <vspace blankLines="1" />

        In particular, this specification defines how to support the provisioning of strong
        credentials to users and/or devices without the need for providing IP connectivity.

        The use of EAP not only for provisiong but also for managing network credentials provides a
        general conduit that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired and WiFi networks
        credentials management).

        <t>
            Because of the increasing number of highly available and highly utilized websites that 
            require secure communications to protect the flow of information from the server 
            to the client and the raising number of devices (IoT) that require strong authentication
            capabilities, the need for a low-cost and efficient approach to network credentials
            management is evident.

            <vspace blankLines="1" />

            This specification addresses the problem of providing a simple-to-use and simple-to-deploy
            system for credentials management by extending the EAP protocol to support credentials
            provisioning and management functionality.

        <t>
            Currently there are many protocols that address the lifecycle of credentials. In particular,
            when it comes to digital certificates, some of the most deployed management protocols are:

                    Lookup the OCSP URI provided in the AIA of the certificate to be checked.
                    The format of the URI comprises the id-ad-ocsp identifier and a base URL
                    where the scheme (``dns://'') is used.
                    The format of the full URI is discussed in <xref target="uri" />.
