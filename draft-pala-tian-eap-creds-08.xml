        <t>
        With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that rely on strong credentials
        (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network access, the need for
        a standardized credentials provisioning and management framework is paramount.

        The 802.1x architecture allows for entities (e.g., devices, applications, etc.) to authenticate to
        the network by providing a communication channel where different methods can be used to
        exchange different types of credentials.

        However, the need for managing these credentials (i.e., provisioning and renewal) is still a
        hard problem to solve.

        EAP-CREDS, if implemented in Managed Networks (e.g., Cable Modems), could
        enable our operators to offer a registration and credentials management service
        integrated in the home WiFi thus enabling visibility about registered devices.
        During initialization, EAP-CREDS also allows for MUD files or URLs to
        be transferred between the EAP Peer and the EAP Server, thus giving
        detailed visibility about devices when they are provisioned with credentials
        for accessing the networks. The possibility provided by EAP-CREDS can help to
        secure home or business networks by leveraging the synergies of the security
        teams from the network operators thanks to the extended knowledge of what
        and how is registered/authenticated.

        This specifications define how to support the provisioning and management of authentication
        credentials that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired, WiFi, cellular, etc.)
        to users and/or devices by using EAP together with standard provisioning protocols.

      <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction"> 
        <t>
          Many environments are, today, moving towards requiring strong authentication when
          it comes to gain access to networks. The 802.1x architecture provides network
          administrators with the possibility to check credentials presented by a device
          even before providing any connectivity or IP services to it.


          However, the provisioning and management of these credentials is a hard problem
          to solve and many vendors opt for long-lived credentials that can not be easily
          revoked, replaced, or simply renewed. 


          This specification addresses the problem of providing a simple-to-use and
          simple-to-deploy conduit for credentials management by extending the EAP
          protocol to support credentials provisioning and management functionality.

          In particular, the EAP-CREDS method defined here provides a generic framework
          that can carry the messages for provisioning different types of credentials.
          EAP-CREDS cannot be used as a stand-alone method, it is required that EAP-CREDS is used
          as an inner method of EAP-TLS, EAP-TEAP, or any other tunneling method that can provide
          the required secrecy and (at minimum) server-side authentication to make sure
          that the communication is protected and with the right server.
        </t>

        <section anchor="existing_solutions" title="Overview of existing solutions">
          <t>
            Currently there are many protocols that address credentials lifecycle management. In particular,
            when it comes to digital certificates, some of the most deployed management protocols are: 
            Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) <xref target="RFC4210" />, Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)
            <xref target="RFC5272"/><xref target="RFC6402"/>, Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
            <xref target="RFC7030"/>, and Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) 
            <xref target="RFC8555"/>.

            However, none of these protocols provide native support for client that do not have IP connectivity
            yet (e.g., because they do not have network-access credentials, yet). EAP-CREDS
            provides the possibility to use such protocols (i.e., message-based) by defining a series of
            messages that can be used to encapsulate the provisioning messages for the selected
            provisioning protocol.

          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="scope" title="Scope Statement">
          <t>
            This document focuses on the definition of the EAP-CREDS method to convey
            credentials provisioning and managing messages between the client and the
            AAA server. Moreover, the document defines how to encode messages for the
            main IETF provisioning protocols.

     
            This document, however, does not provide specifications for how and where
            the credentials are generated. In particular, the credentials could be
            generated directly within the AAA server or at a different location (i.e., the
            Certificate Service Provider or CSP) site. Different authentication
            mechanisms (e.g., TLS, etc.) can be used to secure the communication
            between the server's endpoint and the CSP.

    
          Examples and details of how to use EAP-CREDS encapsulation mechanism with specific protocol are out of scope
          of this document. For more details of using EAP-CREDS method with Simple Provisioning Protocol (SPP), 
          please refer to EAP-CREDS with Simple Provisioning Protocol (SPP) <!--<xref target="RFCXXXX"/>-->.
          For more details of using EAP-CREDS method with Certificate Management Protocol (CMP),
          please refer to EAP-CREDS withwith Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) <!--<xref target="RFCXXXX"/>-->. 
          These two documents can be used as the template for other protocols' encapulation with EAP-CREDS. 
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="tunnel" title="EAP-CREDS as tunneled mechanism only">
          <t>
            EAP-CREDS requires that an outer mechanism is in place between the Peer and
            the Server in order to provide authentication and confidentiality of the
            messages exchanged via EAP-CREDS. In other words, EAP-CREDS assumes that an
            appropriately encrypted and authenticated channel has been established to
            prevent the possibility to leak information or to allow man-in-the-middle attacks.
          </t>
          <t>
            This choice was taken to simplify the message flow between Peer and Server, and
            to abstract EAP-CREDS from the secure-channel establishment mechanism. EAP-TLS,
            or EAP-TEAP are examples of such mechanisms.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="frag" title="Fragmentation Support">
          <t>
            EAP does not directly support handling fragmented packets and it requires
            the outer method to provide fragmentation support.
          </t>
          <t>
            Because of the outer method requirements in particular, removing any
            support for fragmented messages in EAP-CREDS removes the duplication
            of packets (e.g., Acknowledgment Packets) sent across the Peer and
            the Server, thus resulting in a smaller number of exchanged messages.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="teap_creds" title="Encapsulating Provisioning Protocols in EAP-CREDS">
          <t>
            In order to use EAP-CREDS together with your favorite provisioning protocol, the messages
            from the provisioning protocol need to be sent to the other party. In EAP-CREDS, this is
            done by encoding the provisioning protocol messages inside the ('ProtoData') TLV.
            In case the provisioning protocol uses additional data for its operations (e.g., uses
            HTTP Headers), this data can be encoded in a separate ('ProtoHeaders') TLV.
          </t>
          <t>
            Since the implementation of the provisioning endpoint could happen in a (logically or
            physically) different component, a method is needed to identify when a provisioning
            protocol has actually ended. In EAP-CREDS, the 'D' (Done) bit in the message headers
            is used for this purpose.
          </t>
          <t>
            In the first message of Phase Two, the Server provides the client with all the selected
            parameters for one specific credential that needs attention (or for a new credential)
            to be managed by the network. In particular, the server provides, at minimum, the
            ('Protocol') TLV, the ('Action') TLV, and the ('Params') or the 
            ('Creds-Info') TLV.
          </t>
          <t>
            After checking the parameters sent by the Server, if the Peer does not support any of
            the proposed ones, it MUST send a message with one single ('Error') TLV with the appropriate error
            code(s). The server, can then decide if to manage a different set of credentials (if
            more where reported by the Peer in its Phase One message) or if to terminate the EAP
            session with an error.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Peer and the Server exchange Provisioning messages until an error is detected (and the
            appropriate error message is sent to the other party) or until Phase Two is successfully
            completed.

        <section anchor="eap_creds_hashing" title="Algorithm Requirements">
          <t>
              EAP-CREDS uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to verify credentials in phase three
              of the protocol. Peers and Servers MUST support SHA-256 for this purpose.

      <section title="EAP-CREDS Protocol">
        <t>
          In a nutshell, EAP-CREDS provides the abstraction layer on top of which credentials
          provisioning/managing protocols can be deployed thus enabling their use even before
          provisioning IP services.
        </t>
        <t>
            This section outlines the operation of the protocol and message flows.
            The format of the CREDS messages is given in <xref target="creds_msg" />.
        </t>

        <section title="Message Flow">
          <t>
              EAP-CREDS message flow is logically subdivided into three different
              phases: Initialization, Provisioning, and Validation. EAP-CREDS
              enforces the order of phases, i.e. it is not possible to move to an
              earlier phase.
          </t>
          <t>
              Phase transitioning is controlled by the Server. In particular, the
              server, after the last message of a phase, it can decide to either
              (a) start the next phase by sending the first message of the next
              phase, or (b) continue the same phase by sending another "first"
              message of the phase (e.g., managing a second set of credentials) - 
              this is allowed only in Phase Two and Phase Three but NOT in Phase One,
              or (c) terminate the EAP session.
          </t>
          <t>
            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="Phase One (Required).">
                  Initialization. During this phase the Peer and the Server
                  exchange the information needed to select the appropriate
                  credentials management protocol.

                  Phase One flow is composed by only messages.

                  In particular, the Sever sends
                  its initial message of type ('EAP-CREDS-Init'). The Peer replies with
                  the details about which provisioning protocols are supported, and additional
                  information such as the list of installed credentials and, optionally,
                  authorization data (for new credentials registration).
              </t>
              <t hangText="Phase Two (Optional).">
                  Provisioning Protocol Flow. In this phase, the Peer and the Server
                  exchange the provisioning protocol's messages encapsulated in a
                  EAP-CREDS message of type Provisioning. The messages use two main TLVs.
                  The first one is the ('ProtoHeaders') TLV which is optional
                  and carries information that might be normally conveyed via the transport
                  protocol (e.g., HTTP headers). The second one is the ('ProtoData'),
                  which is required and carries the provisioning protocol's
                  messages. The server can decide to repeat
                  phase two again to register new credentials or to renew a separate
                  set of credentials by issuing a new ('Provisioning') message for the
                  new target. When no more credentials have to be managed,
                  the Server can start phase three or simply terminate the EAP session.
              </t>
              <t hangText="Phase Three (Optional).">
                  Credentials Validation. This optional phase can be initiated by
                  the server and it is used to validate that the Peer has properly
                  installed the credentials and can use them to authenticate
                  itself. Depending on the credentials' type, the messages can
                  carry a challenge/nonce, the value of the secret/token, or other
                  information. The format of the credentials is supposed to be
                  known by the provider and the device.

        </section>

        <section anchor="phase_transitioning" title="Phase Transitioning Rules">
          <t>
            In order to keep track of starting and ending a phase, EAP-CREDS defines
            several bits and fields in the EAP-CREDS message headers. In particular,
            as described in <xref target="creds_header" />, the 'S' (Start) bit is
            used to indicate the beginning (or Start) of a phase, while the 'Phase'
            field (4 bits) is used to indicate the phase for this message. 
          </t>
          <t>
            In EAP-CREDS, phase transitioning is under the sole control of the Server,
            therefore the value of the 'S' (Start) bit is meaningful only in messages sent by the Server.
            The value of the 'S' (Start) bit in Peer's messages SHALL be set to '0x0' and SHALL be
            ignored by the server.
          </t>
          <t>
            When starting a new phase, the Server MUST set the 'S' (Start) bit
            to '1' and the 'Phase' field to the current phase number (e.g., 0x01 for phase one, 0x02 for phase two, or 0x03 for phase three).
          </t>
          <t>
            In case the first message of a phase is to be repeated (e.g., because of
            processing multiple credentials), the

              <t>
                After the establishment of the outer
                mechanism (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-TEAP, EAP-TTLS, etc.), the server MAY
                decide to start a credentials management session. In order to do that,
                the Server sends an EAP-Request/EAP-CREDS(Type=Init) message to the Peer with
              the 'S' (Start) bit set to '1' and the Phase field value set to '0x01' 
              (thus indicating the beginning of Phase One) as described in 
              <xref target="creds_header" />. Also, the Server
                MAY use one or more ('Version') TLVs to indicate the supported versions.
              </t>
              <t>
                The Server MAY also specify which versions of EAP-CREDS are supported
                by adding zero, one or more ('Version') TLVs. If no ('Version') TLV is added
                to the message, the Peer SHOULD assume the supported version is 1 ('0x01').
              </t>
            <t>
              Optionally, the Server MAY also send a ('Challenge-Data') TLV
              which includes chanllenge data value (usually some random value)
              and a specified challenge type. The Peer MUST
              use the specified type and use chanllenge data value for calculating 
              the ('Challenge-Response') TLV.
            </t>


            </list>
          </t>
          <t>[2] The Peer sends EAP-Response/EAP-CREDS(Type=Init)
            <list>
              <t>
                The Peer, sends back a message that carries one
                ('Version') TLV to indicate the selected version of EAP-CREDS (i.e.
                from the list provided by the server) (optional). If the client does
                not include the ('Version') TLV, the Server MUST use the most recent
                supported version of EAP-CREDS. Moreover, the Server includes one or
                more ('Protocol') TLVs to indicate the list of supported provisioning
                protocols, followed by one ('Creds-Info') TLVs for each installed
                credentials to provide their status to the server (i.e., if multiple
                credentials are configured on the Peer for this Network, then the Peer
                MUST include one ('Creds-Info') TLV for each of them).
              </t>
              <t>
                The Peer MAY also provide the list of supported Encodings and Formats
                by adding one or more ('Encoding') and ('Formats')
                TLVs. The Peer MAY also provide the Server with information about the
                Peer's credentials storage by using the ('Storage-Info') TLV.
              </t>
              <t>
                When there are no available credentials, the Peer MAY include an authorization
                token that can be consumed by the Server for registering new credentials.
                In particular, the Peer can include the ('Token') TLV to convey the
                value of the token. The ('Challenge-Data') and ('Challenge-Response') TLVs,
                instead, can be used to convey a challenge and its response
                based on the authorization information. For example, suppose a public key hash 
                is present in the Token, the peer can generate some random data - or use the
                one from the Server - and generate a signature on that value: the
                signature SHALL be encoded in the ('Challenge-Response') TLV and it should
                be calculated over the concatenation of values inside the ('Challenge-Data')
                TLV and the ('Token') TLV.
              </t>
              <t>
                Also, the Peer MAY add one or more ('Profile') TLVs to indicate to the Server
                which profiles are requested/supported (e.g., a pre-configuration MAY exist
                on the Peer with these ecosystem-specific identifiers).
              </t>
              <t>
                Ultimately, the Peer MAY include additional metadata regarding the status of
                the Peer. To this end, the Peer can use a ('Storage-Info') TLV to provide the server
                with additional data about the Peer's capabilities and resources. Also, the
                ('Net-Usage') TLV can be used to provide the Server with the indication of
                which network resources are needed by the Peer and what is its intended
                utilization pattern(s).
              </t>
              <t>
                The server checks that the Peer's selected protocol, version, and
                parameters are supported and, if not (or if the server detects an
                error), it can (a) send a non-recoverable error message to the peer,
                notify the outer (tunneling) layer, and terminate the EAP-CREDS session, or
                (b) start phase one again by sending a new ('EAP-CREDS-Init') message
                that will also carry an ('ERROR') TLV that provides the Peer with the
                reason the initial response was not acceptable. In this case, the
                ('Phase') field MUST be omitted since it is not the first message of 
                phase one. The server and the peer can repeat phase one until they reach
                an agreement or the session is terminated by the Server.
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>
            <list>
              <t>
                NOTE WELL: The determination of the need to start phase two or not is based on the
                contents of the ('Creds-Info') TLV sent by the Peer (e.g., a credential
                is about to expire or a credential is simply missing).

                have any more ('Type=Provisioning') messages for this credenital.
                The final message does not need to be an empty one, i.e. other TLVs are still

                that the credentials have been installed correctly. In case of errors, the Peer
                MUST include the appropriate ('Error') TLV.

              <t>
                When the client receives the Validate message from the server, it calculates the
                response to the challenge and sends the response back to the server in a
                EAP-Response/EAP-CREDS(Type=Validate) message. 
                When the 'EAP-CREDS-ASYMMETRIC-CHALLENGE' and 'EAP-CREDS-SYMMETRIC-CHALLENGE' values
                are used in the 'Challenge types', the Peer MUST calculate the response as follows:

                    Public-Key

                      <t>
                          For any public-key based credentials (e.g., certificates or
                          raw key pairs), the response to the challenge is calculated by generating a
                          signature over the hashed value of the challenge. The hashing algorithm
                          to be used for this purpose is specified in <xref target="eap_creds_hashing" />.
                          The format of the signature in the ('Challenge-Response') TLV is the
                          concatenation of:
                          <list style="symbols">

                          (a) the value carried in the server-provided ('Challenge-Data') TLV, and

        <t>
          Where the Code, Identifier, Length, and Type fields are all part of the EAP
          header as defined in <xref target="RFC3748" />. Since EAP-CREDS can only be
          used as a tunneled mechanism, the presence of these fields is only for
          backward compatibility with existing parsers. In particular, the 'Length'
          field is used for fragmentation instead of the message length: 
          the message length is carried in the
          'Message Length' field if Jumbo Message is indicated in the header.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Type field in the EAP header is &lt;TBD&gt; for EAP-CREDS.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Flags bitfield is used to convey status information (e.g., extra long
          message, phase number, phase transitioning state). The transition-control
          bit (i.e., the 'S' (Start) bit) are set in Server's messages and are ignored in
          Peer's messages (the Server is the entity that unilaterally controls the
          phase transition process).
          The meanings of the bits in the 'Flags' field are as follows:
          <list>
            <t>
              Bit 'J' (Jumbo Message) - If set, it indicates the presence of the 'Message Length' field.
                       This bit SHALL be used only when the size of the message exceeds the maximum 
                       value allowed
                       in the 'Length' field. In this case, the 'Message Length' field is
                       added to the message and set to the whole message size and the 'Length'
                       field is used for the current fragment length.
                       If not set, the 'Message Length' field is not
                       present in the Message and the 'Length' field is used for the message size
                       (and the 'F' (Fragment) bit MUST be set to '0').
            </t>
            <t>
                Bit 'S' (Start) - If set, this message is the first one of a new EAP-CREDS phase.
                       The value of the new phase is encoded in the 'Phase' field.
            </t>
            <t>
                Bit 'F' (Fragment) - If set, this message is a fragment of a message. In this case, the
                       'Data' field is to be concatenated with all messages with the 'F' (Fragment) bit
                       set to '1' until the message with the 'F' (Fragment) bit set to '0' that indicates
                       the end of the message. If the message is not fragmented, the 'F' (Fragment) bit
                       MUST be set to '0'. The use of this bit is required when the tunneling
                       method does not provide support for messages up to 2^32 bits in size.
            </t>
            <t>
                Bit 'D' (Done) - This bit is used in Phase Two and Phase Three to indicate that the
                       specific operation for the identified credential is over. For example,
                       when multiple credentials exist on the Peer and the Server needs to
                       manage and validate one of them. In its last message, when the provisioning
                       protocol is done, the server sets the 'D' (Done) bit to indicate that
                       it is done. The Peer, in its reply, sets the bit to indicate
                       the end of provisioning for this credentials is also over. After that, the
                       Server can continue Phase Two, transition to Phase Three, or terminate
                       the EAP session.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The Phase field is a 4-bits value and identifies the EAP-CREDS phase for the current message.
          The version of EAP-CREDS described in this document supports three values for this
          field:
          <list>
            <t>0x01 - Phase One</t>
            <t>0x02 - Phase Two</t>
            <t>0x03 - Phase Three</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          A detailed explanation of the 'Phase' and 'Flags' fields of the message headers
          is provided in <xref target="phase_transitioning" />.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Data field is the message payload. The full description of this field

    <t>
        The Creds-Info TLV is used by the Peer to provide
        a description of the installed credentials that are relevant for
        the network that is being accessed.
    </t>
    <t>
        For example, when a set of credentials need to be renewed, the
        server checks the ('Creds-Info') from the Peer and eventually
        selects the right one for renewal. The TLV structure is as follows:
    </t>
    <t>TLV Type (uint8)
        <list>
            <t>&lt;TBD&gt; - Creds-Info TLV</t>

    </t>
    <t>Length (uint24)
        <list>
            <t>
                Provides the total length of the body of the Creds-Info TLV.
            </t>
        </list>
    </t>
    <t>Flags (uint8)
        <list>
            <t>
                Provides a BITMASK that can be used to provide information
                about the status of the credentials (e.g., if the use marks the
                credentials to be compromised). The bits have the following
                meaning:
                <list>
                    <t>Bit 0 - If set, the credential is marked as compromised</t>
                    <t>Bit 1 - If set, the credential is immutable and cannot be updated</t>
                    <t>Bit 2 - Private Key or Secret Immutable, the public part of the
                               credential (e.g., a certificate) can still be updated</t>
                    <t>Bit 3 - If set, the credential cannot be updated (both public and
                               private parts)</t>
                    <t>Bit 4 - If set, the credential is ready to be used </t>
                    <t>Bit 5 - If set, the credential was generated on the server</t>
                    <t>Bit 6 - If set, the Peer would like to update the credential even
                               if they are not expired</t>
                    <t>Bit 7 - Reserved</t>

    <t>CredType (uint8)
        <list>
            <t>
                This field provides the description of the type of credential. The type

    <t>ProtoID (uint16)
        <list>
            <t>
                This field indicates the protocol that was used to retrieve the target
                credential. When the TLV is used in a Request by the Server, this field
                is ignored.
                The values for this field are listed in <xref target="iana_proto" />.
            </t>
        </list>
    </t>
    <t>IssuedOn (16 octets)
        <list>
            <t>
                This field carries the GMT date for when this credential was issued.
                This field is 16 bytes long (the last byte must be set to '0x00') and
                contains the NULL-terminated ASCII string that represents the timestamp
                where the credential was issued. When the value is not set, the field
                should be set to { 0x00 }. The format of the string is as follows:
            </t>
            <t>
                <list>
                    <t>YYYYMMDDHHmmssZ</t>

                    <t>MM - is the 2 digits representation of the month</t>
                    <t>DD - is the 2 digits representation of the day of the month</t>
                    <t>HH - is the 2 digits representation of the hour of the day (24 hour format)</t>
                    <t>mm - is the 2 digits representation of the minutes of the hour</t>
                    <t>ss - is the 2 digits representation of the seconds of the minute</t>
                    <t>Z - is the character 'Z'</t>

        </list>
    </t>
    <t>ExpiresOn (16 octets)
        <list>
            <t>
                This field carries the GMT date for when this credential is to be considered
                expired. This field is 16 bytes long (the last byte must be set to '0x00') and
                contains the NULL-terminated ASCII string that represents the timestamp where
                the credential was issued. The format is the same as the ('IssuedOn') field.
                When the value is not set, the field should be set to { 0x00 }.
            </t>
        </list>
    </t>
    <t>Credentials Length (uint32) <!-- Yuan: why uint16? !-->
        <list>
            <t>
                Length (in bytes) of the Credentials value. When used with a public-key
                type of credentials, this is the size of the key (e.g., for an RSA 2048
                bit keys, this field should carry the value of 256). When used with a
                symmetric secret, this field carries the size of the secret (in bytes).
            </t>
        </list>
    </t>
    <t>CredIDValue (> 1 octet)
        <list>
            <t>
                The binary value of the credentials' identifier. This identifier can be the
                binary value of the SHA-256 calculated over the certificate, a username, or
                it could be a random handle. As long as the ID allows the peer and the server to
                uniquely (in its context) identify the credentials, the value of this field
                can be calculated in any way.

        <list>
          <t>
            This field provide the expected data format for the Net-Usage Data. For example,
            the value in this field could be set to 'MUD' and have the 'U' bit set to '1' to
            provide the MUD-related information at credentials management time instead of at
            network-provisioning time (DHCP option). This possibility could help the Network
            controller to decide if the device shall be allowed to register its credentials
            or not.
            The initial values for this field are listed in 
            <xref target="iana_usage_metadata_type" />.

    <t>The 'U' field (1 bit)
      <list>
        <t>
          The 'URL' bit ('U') is used to indicate if the value of the Net-Usage Data field
          is to be interpreted as a URL or as the actual data. In particular, if the value in
          the 'URL' bit is '1', then the value in the Net-Usage Data field is to be
          interpreted as the URL where the actual data can be downloaded from. Otherwise, if
          the 'URL' bit is set to '0', then the value in the Net-Usage Data field is to be
          interpreted as the actual data (not a URL referencing it).
        </t>
        <t>
          An example use of this bit is when the Peer wants to convey the URL of the MUD file
          <xref target="RFC8520" />. In this case, the Peer can set the Net-Usage Data field
          to the URL of the MUD file related to the Peer.

      </list>
    </t>
    <t>Net-Usage Data (octet string)
        <list>
            <t>
                This is additional information related to the device. In particular,
                this TLV can be used by the Peer to provide the Server with the description
                of the intended network usage or a URL that points to the same information.
            </t>
            <t>
                For example, this field can be used to convey a MUD file (Manufacturer
                Usage Description) or the latest firmware-update manifest.

                For example, when used with a symmetric key or a password, the

                maximum size of the password data. The ('Algor OID') field can

            <t>
                On the other hand, when referring public-key credentials, this
                field should carry the size of the modulus of the key. For example,
                for an RSA 2048 bit keys, the field should carry the value of 256.
                For an ECDSA that uses the prime256r1 curve, this field should
                carry the value of 32 and the Algor OID should be the DER
                representation of the specific value of the curve (i.e., the DER
                representation of '1.2.840.10045.3.1.7').

                about the status of the credentials (e.g., if the use marks the
                credentials to be compromised). The bits have the following
                meaning:
                <list>
                    <t>Bit 0 - Credentials (or part of it) are to be generated on the server</t>

            <t>
              When using public-key based credentials, the bits 0 and 1 are mutually exclusive.
            </t>
            <t>
              When using passwords or shared secrets, if bit 0 is set, then the secret is generated
              by the server and then sent to the client. On the other hand, if bit 1 is set, then the
              secret is generated by the peer and then sent to the server. Ultimately, if both bits
              are set, then the Server generates the first part of the password and sends it to the
              Peer, while the Peer generates the second part of the password and sends it to the
              Server. The password to be used for future authentication is the concatenation of the
              two shares of the password: first the one from the Server, then the one from the Client.

                  Last but not least, since these passwords/secrets are meant to be used in a automated
                  fashion, there is no restriction around the character set to use or their interpretation.
                  Therefore, it is good practice to generate random pass-phrases that use the full 8-bit
                  character set (on client and server) to maximize the secret's search space.

            <t>
                The EAP-CREDS-Init message type is used in Phase One only of EAP-CREDS. The
                message flow is depicted in <xref target="creds_phase_one" />. This message
                supports the following TLVs: Version, Protocol, Creds-Info, and Error.
            </t>

            <section anchor="creds_msg_server_init" title="EAP Server's Init Message">
                <t>
                    EAP-CREDS starts with an ('EAP-CREDS-Init') message from the server. This
                    message MAY contain zero, one, or more ('Version') TLVs and, optionally, a
                    ('Challenge-Data') TLV.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The first message from the server is the one that starts Phase One, therefore
                    the Server MUST set the headers' 'S' (Start) bit to '1' (Start) and the headers' 'Phase' value
                    to '1' (Phase One).
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Server uses one or more ('Version') TLVs in the EAP-Request/EAP-CREDS(Type=Init)
                    message to provide the Peer with the list of EAP-CREDS versions supported. If omitted,
                    the implicit version of EAP-CREDS used in the session is one ('0x1').
                    If the Server detects multiple occurrences of this TLV in the reply from the Peer,
                    an error shall be issued and the EAP-CREDS session should be terminated.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In case Token-Based registration is enabled on the Server, the Server MUST
                    include, in its Init message, a ('Challenge-Data') field that can be used by
                    the client to provide challenge data for proof-of-possession of secrets.
                </t>
            </section>

            <section anchor="creds_msg_peer_init" title="EAP Peer's Init Message">
                <t>
                    The Peer MUST reply to the Server's ('EAP-CREDS-Init') message with its own
                    ('EAP-CREDS-Init') one. The Peer SHOULD include one ('Version') TLV
                    in its first message to indicate the version of EAP-CREDS that the client wants to use for the
                    session. The Peer MUST also provide the list of supported provisioning
                    protocols (via one or more the 'Protocol' TLV), the list and status of the installed
                    credentials (via the 'Creds-Info' TLV). The Peer MAY include
                    authorization data when registering new credentials (e.g., an authorization
                    token or a device certificate) via the ('Token') and ('Challenge-Response')
                    TLV.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The Peer MUST include one ('Creds-Info') TLV for each credential the
                    Network is authorized to manage. Typically, a Peer will include only one
                    ('Creds-Info') TLV in its ('EAP-CREDS-Init') message, but there might
                    be cases where multiple types of credentials are available and selected depending on
                    the location and other factors (e.g., X.509 certificate and username/password combination).
                </t>
                <t>
                    In case the Peer does not have any credentials available yet, it does not
                    add any ('Creds-Info') TLV - leaving the Server with the only action
                    possible: Registration. In this case, the Peer SHOULD include authorization information
                    via the ('Token') TLV as described in <xref target="creds_msg_peer_init_token" />.
                    Additionally, the Peer can add the ('Profile') TLV to indicate a preferred profile
                    for the credentials.
                </t>

                <section anchor="creds_msg_peer_init_token" title="Bootstrapping Peer's Trustworthiness">
                    <t>
                        When the Peer does not have any valid credentials for the Network that it is
                        authenticating to, it does not provide any ('Creds-Info') TLV. This indicates
                        to the Server that new credentials MUST be registered before the Peer is allowed
                        on the network.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The Registration process might rely on information exchanged during the
                        Provisioning Process in Phase Two. However, if an authorization mechanism
                        is not available from the supported provisioning protocol and no credentials
                        are available on the Peer, EAP-CREDS provides a simple mechanism for the Peer to
                        leverage an out-of-band token/passphrase/ott that may be already available
                        on the Peer (e.g., a device certificate or a 'spendable' credentials token
                        like a kerberos ticket or a crypto-currency transaction) and that can be
                        verified by the Server.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        In particular, when the Peer wants to register new credentials (and the Server
                        requires the use of additional authorization data) it may need to provide (a) a Token, (b) a challenge
                        value, and (c) a response to the challenge value. To do so, the Peer MUST
                        encode the token in a ('Token') TLV, the challenge value in a ('Challenge-Data')
                        TLV, and, finally, the response to the challenge in the ('Challenge-Response')
                        TLV.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The use of ('Challenge-Data') and ('Challenge-Response') TLVs is optional, however
                        it is suggested that if a token is used for bootstrapping the trust, it should
                        provide a way to verify a secret associated with it.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        It is also very important that the authorization token is disclosed only to
                        authorized servers - the Peer MUST NOT disclose authorization tokens that are
                        not meant for the network that is being accessed. This can be done, usually,
                        by verifying the identity of the Server first (in the outer mechanism) and then
                        verify that the target of the Token is the Server the Client is talking to.

                </t>
                <t>
                    The Server uses one or more IdProvider TLVs in the EAP-Request/EAP-CREDS(Type=Init)
                    message to provide the Peer with the list of supported credentials providers. The server
                    can omit the set of TLVs in case a single provider is supported (or if the selection of the
                    provider is done based on different factors - e.g., the authenticated credentials via

                    it wants the Server to use. The Peer MUST pick from the list provided in the

                    listed in the Server's message or if no selection is provided and the Peer
                    requires a specific provider, then an EAP-Response/EAP-CREDS(Type=Init) with

                where it encodes all the required details for starting the provisioning process.
                In particular, the server sends the selected ('Action'), ('Protocol'), and metadata

                From now on, the conversation between the Peer and the Server continues until
                an error is detected or the provisioning protocol completes successfully.
            </t>
            <t>
                If no other actions, the server MAY continue with phase three or issue a
                success message and terminate the EAP session.

        <section anchor="creds_msg_validate" title="The EAP-CREDS-Validate Message">
            <t>
                The EAP-CREDS-Validate message type is used in Phase Three only of EAP-CREDS. The
                message flow is depicted in <xref target="creds_phase_three" />. This message type
                supports the following TLVs: Protocol, Creds-Info, ProtoHeaders,
                ProtoData, Token, and Error.
            </t>
            <t>
                After Phase One (and/or Phase Two) ends, the Server MAY start phase three by issuing an
                ('EAP-CREDS-Validate') message for the Peer where it encodes all the required details
                for starting the validation process.
                In particular, the server sends the ('Creds-Info'), a ('Challenge-Data'),
                and the ('Phase') fields in a EAP-Request/EAP-CREDS(Type=Validate) message.
                The ('Phase') field should carry the '1' value for the 'S' (Start) bit (Start) and the
                number '3' for its value (Phase Three begins).
            </t>
            <t>
                The Peer generates the answer to the Challenge and sends back a EAP-Response/EAP-CREDS(Type=Validate)
                message with the ('Challenge-Response') and an optional ('Challenge-Data') field (only for
                server-side validation of the symmetric credentials). If the Peer requested server-side
                validation of the credentials, the Server MUST include (if a symmetric secret) the
                response to the Peer-issued ('Challenge-Data') TLV by computing the response and adding it
                to the ('Challenge-Response') TLV in its reply.
            </t>
            <t>
                Finally, in the last message, the Server (if Phase Three is to be ended) SHALL include
                the ('Phase') field with the 'S' (Start) bit set to '0' (end of phase) and the value set
                to '3' (Phase Three ended).
            </t>
            <t>
                At this point, EAP-CREDS has terminated all possible operations and can be terminated.
                The Server can now terminate the EAP session successfully. In case the Peer was not
                authenticated during the tunnel establishment (i.e., no credentials were already
                available on the Peer), the Server should terminate the EAP session with a Failure
                (thus requiring the device to re-attach and authenticate to the network - phase two
                should have provided the Peer with the credentials to use for authenticating to the
                Network).

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
        <t>
            Several security considerations need to be explicitly considered for the system administrators
            and application developers to understand the weaknesses of the overall architecture.
        </t>
        <t>
            The most important security consideration when deploying EAP-CREDS is related to the
            security of the outer channel. In particular, EAP-CREDS assumes that the communication
            channel has been properly authenticated and that the information exchanged between
            the Peer and the Server are protected (i.e., confidentiality and integrity).
        </t>
        <t>
          For example, if certificate-based authentication is used, the server presents a
          certificate to the peer as part of the trust establishment (or negotiation).
          The peer SHOULD verify the validity of the EAP server certificate and SHOULD also
          examine the EAP server name presented in the certificate in order to determine
          whether the EAP server can be trusted.  When performing server certificate validation,
          implementations MUST provide support for the rules in <xref target="RFC5280" /> for
          validating certificates against a known trust anchor.
